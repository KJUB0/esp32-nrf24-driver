I'm building a custom bare-metal driver for the NRF24L01+ radio on the ESP32 using the ESP-IDF framework. Instead of just grabbing a pre-made Arduino library, I'm writing the SPI protocol implementation from scratch to figure out how hardware registers, memory management, and low-level communication actually work under the hood.

More information comming soon.
